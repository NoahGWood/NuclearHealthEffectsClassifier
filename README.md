# Nuclear Health Effects Classifier
Nuclear Health Effects Classifier is an open-source classifier developed to predict survival and cancer rates from exposure to radiation >= 250mSv.

## Purpose

This classifier was developed as part of an undergraduate proposal to demonstrate the benefits of updating our atomic incident response technologies to the 21st century. It has been released to the public in the hope that it may prove useful. The proposal paper this classifier was developed for is also provided herein.

## How To Use

Simply clone the repository and run the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoahGWood/NuclearHealthEffectsClassifier.git
cd NuclearHealthEffectsClassifier
./main.py
```

## Weights

A full set of trained weights is provided in the full_weights file. This script generates a set of weights using training data. The default setting creates weights based on randomly selected samples from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki database, to create weights based on the full training data, comment line #102 and uncomment line #103.  Weights are stored in a file 'weights' as a comma separated value of lists formatted as such:
		[survival_classifier], [cancer_classifier], [solid_cancer_classifier], [hema_cancer_classifier], [leukemia_cancer_classifier]
